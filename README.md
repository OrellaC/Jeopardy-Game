<h3><u>Description:</u></h3> 
This game is based on the popular Jeopardy game show. It is called "What Do You Know". It is a two-player trivia game that tests your knowledge on various topics.

<h3><u>How it works:</u></h3>
            <li>Players can select any of the provided categories. The number on each box/card represents how many points the question under that category is worth</li>
            <li> After the player selects a category, they will have 30 seconds to answer as many questions as they can. After one round (1 minute), players can declare a winner or continue playing the game to accumulate more points</li>
            <li>If answered correctly, the player will receive the amount of points the question was worth. If answered incorrectly, the player will not earn any points. </li>
            <li>The player with the most points after each round is the winner</li>

<h3><u>Installation Instructions:</u></h3> None. This game is played 100% through the user's web browser

<h3><u>Technologies Used:</u></h3> HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript  

<h3><u>Approach Taken:</u></h3> Initially I attempted to make this project from scracth (without any help). However, after an entire week with little to no progress, I decided to watch trivia/jeopardy game tutorials for guidance. 
I followed this tutorial mostly (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgHim4ZDpZY) to create my game. I added my own code to this tutorial.
<h3><u>Changes Made to Tutorial:</u></h3>
<li>The tutorial is one player. I manipulated my project to make it two player</li>
<li> I created a function that track's the score of each player in real time </li>
<li> I added a timer in order to create a win-lose state</li>
<li> I created my own HTML and CSS designs </li>

<h3><u> Unsolved Issues:</u></h3> 
<li> The biggest issue with my project right now is that after each round the trivia categories duplicate. I can't seem to figure out why that is but I know it most likely has to do with one of the functions/iterations.
However, I didn't have enough time to fix it. </li>
<li> Some questions extend outside of the vategory card and doesn't allow the user to locate the true or false buttons. In additions some boxes are empty. </li>
<li> I have a few minor CSS issues. Such as centering one of my flexboxes </li>

<h3><u> Future Plans for Game:</u></h3>
I'd first like to solve all of the previously mentioned unsolved issues. In addition, I would like to create my own API that generates my own questions. 
All of the tutorials I followed to create a trivia game used an API because "it's easier than creating your own questions in the form of an array" (Less time consuming). 
I would also like to incorporate some cool CSS elements such as animations and media. For example, implementing a sound when a question is answered incorreclty.
