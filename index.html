        <h3> "What Do You Know?" is a two-player trivia game that tests your knowledge on various topics. </h3>
    

        <h3><u>Here's how it works:</u></h3>
   
        <ul style="line-height: 1.7;">
            <li>Players can select any of the provided categories. The number on each box represents how much the question under that category is worth</li>
            <li> After the player selects a category, they will have 15 seconds to answer as many questions as they can. After one round (1 minute), players can declare a winner or continue playing the game to accumulate more points</li>
            <li>If answered correctly, the player will receive the amount of points the question was worth. If answered incorrectly, the player will not earn any points. </li>
            <li>The player with the most points after each round is the winner</li>
        </ul>
