        <h3> "What You Know?" is a two-player modern trivia game that tests your overall pop-culture knowledge. </h3>

        <h3>Here's how it works:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Players can select any of the provided categories. The number on each box represents how much the question under that category is worth</li>
            <li> After the player selects a category, they will have 30 seconds to answer as many questions as they can. After one minute, players can declare a winnder (the player with the most correct answers) or continue playing the game</li>
            <li>If answered correctly, the player will receive the amount of points the question was worth. If the answered incorrectly, the player will not earn any points. </li>
            <li>Players will have a total of 30 seconds to answer as many questions as they can. The player with the most points after 30 seconds is the winner</li>
        </ol>
